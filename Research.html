                                    Copyright is a type of intellectual property (IP) that protects original works of authorship, such as literature, music, art, and software.<br>
                                    Protection occurs automatically once the work is created and does not require registration.<br>
                                    Rights of the copyright holder: The owner has exclusive rights to copy, distribute, perform, or modify the work.<br>

                                    Creative Commons (CC) provides a set of free licenses that enable creators to share their works under flexible conditions.<br>
                                    Types of licenses: There are six main types, ranging from CC BY (least restrictive, requiring only attribution) to CC BY-NC-ND (which restricts commercial use and derivatives).<br>
                                    Key elements of the licenses:<br>
                                    BY (Attribution): Credit must be given to the creator.<br>
                                    NC (Non-Commercial): Works cannot be used for commercial purposes.<br>
                                    ND (No Derivatives): Works cannot be altered or remixed.<br>
                                    SA (Share Alike): Derivative works must carry the same license as the original.<br>

                                    Key principles: The Privacy Act 2020 governs how personal data is collected, stored, and shared in New Zealand.<br>
                                    Rights of individuals: Individuals have the right to access and correct their personal information.<br>
                                    Best practices for data privacy:<br>
                                    Minimize data collection to only what is necessary.<br>
                                    Ensure strong security measures for storing and transmitting data.<br>

                                    In New Zealand, fair dealing is a provision similar to fair use in other countries, allowing limited use of copyrighted works without permission.<br>
                                    Permissible uses include:<br>
                                    Research or private study: Using portions of a work for personal or academic purposes.<br>
                                    Criticism, review, or news reporting: Using parts of copyrighted material for critique or news.<br>
                                    Educational purposes: Limited copying for teaching or study in educational institutions.<br>
                                    Fair dealing has limitations, and the usage must not negatively impact the copyright holder’s ability to exploit the work commercially.<br>

                                    Creative Commons (CC) licenses offer an alternative to traditional copyright, allowing creators to set flexible usage terms for their work.<br>
                                    Fair use still applies under CC licenses, meaning users may utilize content without explicit permission if it falls under fair use exceptions, such as:<br>
                                    Quotations for criticism or review.<br>
                                    Parody or satire.<br>
                                    Educational use within the boundaries of the license.<br>
                                    Creative Commons licenses facilitate sharing and reuse of creative content but do not override existing fair use rights in copyright law.<br>

                                    Key principles from the Privacy Act 2020:<br>
                                    Transparency: Organizations must inform individuals about why and how their personal data is collected and used.<br>
                                    Data minimization: Only collect data that is necessary for the purpose at hand.<br>

                                    Website publishing is the process of making a website accessible on the internet, typically done after designing and developing the site.<br>
                                    Steps in web publishing:<br>
                                    Domain registration: Purchase and register a domain name to serve as the website's address (e.g., www.example.com).<br>
                                    Choosing a web host: Select a web hosting provider that fits your site's needs (shared, VPS, dedicated, etc.).<br>
                                    Uploading files: Use FTP (File Transfer Protocol) or a web hosting platform's file manager to upload website files to the server.<br>
                                    DNS configuration: Point the domain name to the web hosting server using DNS (Domain Name System) settings, making the site accessible via the domain.<br>

                                    Web hosting refers to the service of providing storage and access for website files on a server. It is essential for making a site live on the internet.<br>
                                    Web publishing, on the other hand, is the process of creating and uploading website content to the internet via a web host.<br>
                                    Key differences:<br>
                                    Web hosting involves providing server space and related infrastructure.<br>
                                    Web publishing involves managing content, design, and ensuring the site is updated regularly.<br>
                                    In summary, web hosting is the technical side (servers, domains, bandwidth), while web publishing focuses on the content and presentation of the website.</p>
